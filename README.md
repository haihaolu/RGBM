# Randomized gradient boosting machine training for a1a dataset from LIBSVM

##Download dataset
download a1a dataset from https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html and store it as `../dataset/a1a.txt`.

##Training
```bash
# train for 100 epoches of a1a by RGBM with different t value, and store the results at `../output/a1a.mat`
python libsvm_data.py 100 a1a
```

##Plotting figures
```bash
# train for 100 epoches of a1a by RGBM with different t value, and store the results at `../output/a1a.mat`
python libsvm_data.py 100 a1a
```
