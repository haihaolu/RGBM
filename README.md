# Randomized Gradient Boosting Machine

This repo contains demo implementations of the a1a training code based on the following paper:

> Haihao Lu and Rahul Mazumder. _Randomized Gradient Boosting Machine._ https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10158

## Trains
```bash
# train for 100 epoches of a1a by RGBM with different t value, and store the results at `../output/a1a.mat`
python libsvm_data.py 100 a1a
```

## Plots figure
```bash
# train for 100 epoches of a1a by RGBM with different t value, and store the results at `../output/a1a.mat`
python libsvm_data.py 100 a1a
```
